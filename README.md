# SketchEdAI
SketchEdAI: A computer vision and AI-powered educational game designed for young children.

Inspired by Google's Quick, Draw! project (https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/), I leveraged a subset of the data (https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) collected from this project, to create my own project, SketchEdAI.

SketchEdAI is a Computer Vision - based educational game powered by Neural Networks, designed to provide a fun and engaging learning experience for young children. The game helps users learn to identify and recognize different objects by challenging them to draw specific categories, accompanied by interesting facts. SketchEdAI guides users through the drawing process, offering hints when needed to ensure they stay on track.
